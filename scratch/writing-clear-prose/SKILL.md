# Writing Clear Prose

Based on Strunk & White's *The Elements of Style*.

## Overview

Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that every sentence be short, but that every word tell.

Three master rules govern all the rest: **use the active voice, omit needless words, be clear.**

## When to Use

**Use when writing:**
- Cover letters, outreach emails, follow-ups
- LinkedIn profile sections (headline, about, experience)
- Blog posts, essays, narrative content
- Non-technical documentation (README intros, project descriptions)
- Any prose where persuasion or clarity matters

**Do not use for:**
- Code comments and docstrings (use writing-for-a-technical-audience)
- API documentation (use writing-for-a-technical-audience)
- Commit messages
- Chat messages or casual conversation

## Active Voice

The subject acts. Passive constructions bury the agent, waste words, and drain energy.

| Passive (weak) | Active (strong) |
|----------------|-----------------|
| My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me. | I shall always remember my first visit to Boston. |
| Mistakes were made by the team. | The team made mistakes. |
| A survey of this region was made in 1900. | The geological service surveyed this region in 1900. |
| There were dead leaves lying on the ground. | Dead leaves covered the ground. |

Passive voice is acceptable when the receiver of the action is the true subject, or when the agent is genuinely unknown. Never use passive to avoid directness.

## Omit Needless Words

Every filler phrase has a shorter replacement. Use it.

| Wordy | Direct |
|-------|--------|
| owing to the fact that | because |
| in spite of the fact that | although |
| the question as to whether | whether |
| in a hasty manner | hastily |
| He is a man who works hard. | He works hard. |
| This is a subject that deserves attention. | This subject deserves attention. |
| the fact that he had not succeeded | his failure |
| used for fuel purposes | used for fuel |
| in order to | to |

**"The fact that"** is always deadwood. Every occurrence can be revised out.

## Positive Form

State what something *is*, not merely what it is *not*. Negative constructions are weak and evasive.

| Negative (evasive) | Positive (direct) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| He was not very often on time. | He usually came late. |
| She did not remember the meeting. | She forgot the meeting. |
| He did not pay attention to the speaker. | He ignored the speaker. |
| The weather was not very pleasant. | The weather was cold and damp. |
| Not honest. | Dishonest. |
| Did not have much confidence in. | Distrusted. |

Use "not" for denial or antithesis, never as evasion.

## Definite, Specific, Concrete Language

Prefer the specific to the general, the concrete to the abstract. Vague language signals vague thinking.

| Vague | Concrete |
|-------|----------|
| A period of unfavorable weather set in. | It rained every day for a week. |
| He showed satisfaction as he accepted the gift. | He grinned as he pocketed the coin. |
| The student made progress. | Maria raised her exam scores from 68 to 89. |

Concrete language creates pictures. Abstract language creates fog.

## Parallel Structure

When two or more ideas are grammatically equivalent, express them in equivalent form. This applies especially to correlatives: both/and, not only/but also, either/or.

| Broken | Parallel |
|--------|----------|
| She likes reading, writing, and to paint. | She likes reading, writing, and painting. |
| It was both a long ceremony and very tedious. | The ceremony was both long and tedious. |
| Either you must grant his request or incur his displeasure. | You must either grant his request or incur his displeasure. |

## Emphasis at the End

The end of a sentence is its strongest position. The beginning is second-strongest. The middle is weakest.

| Buried emphasis | End emphasis |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways. | Humanity has advanced in many other ways since that time, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude. |

Place the word or phrase you want the reader to remember at the end of the sentence.

## Sentence-Level Hygiene

**Dangling modifiers** must refer to the grammatical subject:
- BAD: "Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house cheaply."
- GOOD: "Because the house was dilapidated, I was able to buy it cheaply."

**Comma splices** are two independent clauses joined only by a comma. Use a semicolon, period, or conjunction:
- BAD: "Stevenson's romances are entertaining, they are full of adventures."
- GOOD: "Stevenson's romances are entertaining; they are full of adventures."

**Related words stay together.** "He only found two mistakes" means something different from "He found only two mistakes." Place modifiers next to what they modify.

## Paragraph Structure

Each paragraph is one idea. Open with a topic sentence that states the subject. Develop it with specifics. A paragraph without a controlling idea is a collection of stray sentences.

## Write with Nouns and Verbs

Nouns and verbs carry the sentence. Adjectives and adverbs are supplements, not substitutes.

| Decorated | Direct |
|-----------|--------|
| The incredibly beautiful, vibrant sunset gradually faded slowly away. | The sunset faded. |
| The shimmering, gossamer, ethereal light of dawn kissed the trembling morning dew. | Dawn broke, and the dew caught the light. |

## Do Not Overstate

Hyperbole defeats itself. When everything is amazing, nothing is. The reader distrusts a writer who reaches for extremes.

| Overstated | Measured |
|------------|---------|
| This is the most important discovery in the history of human civilization. | This discovery may reshape how we understand memory. |
| She was incredibly talented beyond belief. | She was talented. |

A single "remarkable" lands harder than three "incredibles."

## Commonly Misused Words

| Word | Rule |
|------|------|
| affect / effect | Affect is a verb (to influence). Effect is a noun (a result). |
| that / which | That restricts (no comma). Which adds information (comma). |
| fewer / less | Fewer for countable things. Less for quantities. |
| comprise | The whole comprises the parts. Never "comprised of." |
| due to | Adjective only. Use "because of" in adverbial phrases. |
| disinterested | Means impartial, not uninterested. |
| literally | Means actually happened. Not an intensifier. |

## Qualifiers to Cut

"Rather," "very," "little," "pretty," "quite" — these soften sentences that should stand firm.

| Qualified | Strong |
|-----------|--------|
| She was very tired. | She was exhausted. |
| It was a rather important decision. | It was an important decision. |
| It was quite cold outside. | It was freezing. |

Choose a stronger word instead of propping up a weak one with a qualifier.

## Review Checklist

Before finalizing any prose, verify:

- [ ] Active voice throughout (passive only where justified)
- [ ] No "the fact that" or "in order to" — deadwood removed
- [ ] Statements in positive form (says what *is*, not what *isn't*)
- [ ] Concrete details, not vague abstractions
- [ ] Parallel structure in lists and correlatives
- [ ] Emphasis falls at end of key sentences
- [ ] No dangling modifiers
- [ ] Qualifiers ("very," "rather," "quite") eliminated or replaced with stronger words
- [ ] No overstatement or hyperbole
- [ ] Every word earns its place
