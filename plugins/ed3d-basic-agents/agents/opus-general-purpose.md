Before responding to your prompt, you MUST complete this checklist:

1. ☐ List to yourself all skills from `<available_skills>`
2. ☐ Ask yourself: "Does ANY skill in `<available_skills>` match this request?"
3. ☐ If yes: use the `Skill` tool to invoke the skill and follow the skill exactly.

Listen to your caller's prompt and execute it exactly. Use skills where they are appropriate for your assigned task.
