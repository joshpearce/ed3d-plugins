# Starting an Implementation Plan

## Overview

Orchestrate the transition from design document to executable implementation through planning and execution handoff.

**Core principle:** Branch -> Plan -> Execute. Isolate work, create detailed tasks, hand off to execution.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the starting-an-implementation-plan skill to create the implementation plan from your design."

## REQUIRED: Design Plan Path

**DO NOT GUESS.** If the user has not provided a path to a design plan, you MUST ask for it.

Use AskUserQuestion:
```
Question: "Which design plan should I create an implementation plan for?"
Options:
  - [list any design plans you find in docs/design-plans/]
  - "Let me provide the path"
```

If `docs/design-plans/` doesn't exist or is empty, ask the user to provide the path directly.

**Never assume, infer, or guess which design plan to use.** The user must explicitly tell you.

## The Process

This skill has three phases:

1. **Branch Setup:** Select and create branch for implementation
2. **Planning:** Create detailed implementation plan
3. **Execution Handoff:** Direct user to execute the plan

### Phase 1: Branch Setup

Before planning, set up the branch and workspace for implementation work.

Extract a friendly name from the design plan filename (e.g., `oauth2-service-auth` from `2025-01-18-oauth2-service-auth.md`).

**Step 1: Ask about worktree**

**REQUIRED: Use AskUserQuestion tool**

Ask:
```
Question: "Do you want to use a git worktree for this implementation?"
Options:
  - "Yes - create worktree" (isolated workspace in .worktrees/[friendly-name])
  - "No - work in current directory" (standard branch workflow)
```

**Step 2: Set up workspace based on choice**

**If user chooses "Yes - create worktree":**

1. **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use ed3d-plan-and-execute:using-git-worktrees
2. **CONDITIONAL SKILLS:** Activate any project-specific git worktree skills if they exist
3. Announce: "I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to create an isolated workspace."
4. Ask user which branch to use for the worktree:
   ```
   Question: "Which branch should I use for this worktree?"
   Options:
     - "[friendly-name]" (e.g., oauth2-service-auth)
     - "$(whoami)/[friendly-name]" (e.g., ed/oauth2-service-auth)
   ```
5. Create worktree:
   - Default location (unless directed otherwise): `$repoRoot/.worktrees/[friendly-name]`
   - Branch from main/master
   - Follow using-git-worktrees skill for safety verification and setup
6. Change to worktree directory
7. Announce: "Worktree created at `.worktrees/[friendly-name]` on branch `[branch-name]`"

**If user chooses "No - work in current directory":**

1. Ask user which branch to use:
   ```
   Question: "Which branch should I use for this implementation?"
   Options:
     - "Use current branch" (stay on current branch, no branch creation)
     - "[friendly-name]" (e.g., oauth2-service-auth)
     - "$(whoami)/[friendly-name]" (e.g., ed/oauth2-service-auth)
   ```
2. **If "Use current branch":** Continue with current branch (no git commands)
3. **If branch name provided:**
   - Determine main branch name: Check if `main` or `master` exists
   - Create new branch from main/master: `git checkout -b [branch-name] origin/[main-or-master]`
   - Verify branch created successfully
   - Announce: "Created and checked out branch `[branch-name]` from `origin/[main-or-master]`"
4. **If branch creation fails:** Report error to user and ask if they want to use current branch instead

**THEN proceed to Phase 2.**

### Phase 2: Planning

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use ed3d-plan-and-execute:writing-implementation-plans

Announce: "I'm using the writing-implementation-plans skill to create the detailed implementation plan."

The writing-implementation-plans skill will:
- Verify scope (<=8 phases from design plan)
- Verify codebase state with investigator
- Create phase-by-phase implementation tasks
- Validate each phase with user before proceeding
- Write implementation plan to `docs/implementation-plans/`

**Output:** Complete implementation plan written to files, on appropriate branch.

### Phase 3: Execution Handoff

After planning is complete, hand off to execution.

**Do NOT invoke execute-plan directly.** The user needs to compact context first.

Instead, provide copy-paste instructions:

```
Implementation plan complete!

To execute this plan, run these commands in sequence:

(1) Compact your context first:
```
/compact
```

(2) Then start execution:
```
/ed3d-ed3d-plan-and-execute:execute-implementation-plan @docs/implementation-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name> .
```

(the `.` at the end is necessary or else Claude Code will eat the command and do the wrong thing.)

The execute-implementation-plan command will implement the plan task-by-task with code review between tasks.
```

**Why two separate commands:**
- User can only paste one command at a time
- /compact must run first to free up context
- Execution needs fresh context to work effectively

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Invoking execute-implementation-plan directly | Provide copy-paste instructions instead |
| Combining compact and execute-implementation-plan | Separate into two command blocks |
| Not specifying full path to plan | Include exact path with phase_01.md |
| Forgetting to mention compact first | Always tell user to compact before execute |

## Integration with Workflow

This skill sits between design and execution:

```
Design Plan (in docs/design-plans/)
  -> User runs /start-implementation-plan with design path

Starting Implementation Plan (this skill)
  -> Phase 1: Branch Setup
    -> Ask if user wants worktree
    -> If yes: invoke using-git-worktrees, create at .worktrees/[friendly-name]
    -> If no: ask which branch, create branch from main/master if needed

  -> Phase 2: Planning
    -> Invoke writing-implementation-plans
    -> Detailed task planning
    -> Phase-by-phase validation
    -> Write to docs/implementation-plans/

  -> Phase 3: Execution Handoff
    -> Provide /compact command
    -> Provide /execute-implementation-plan command with path
    -> User runs commands in sequence

Execute Implementation Plan (next step)
  -> Reads implementation plan
  -> Implements task-by-task
  -> Code review between tasks
```

**Purpose:** Bridge design and execution with appropriate branch isolation and context management.
