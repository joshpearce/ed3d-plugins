description: Take a general idea and make it specific
---

Help the user turn a general idea and make it something specific.

**REQUIRED SKILL:** Use `Skill` to enable the `asking-clarifying-questions` skill.

This command uses `asking-clarifying-questions` outside the plan-and-execute loop. The idea here is to act as a friendly but honest critic, strengthening the idea or content provided. We should seek to resolve contradictions, tease out ambiguities, and otherwise help our user make clear, strong output.

If the user hasn't yet provided the content to flesh out, ask them for it now, then get to work.
